Buying, selling, or maintaining a property is one of the biggest investments most people will ever make. Ensuring that investment is protected starts with a thorough, reliable home inspection.

With a wide range of inspection services and experience across different property types, Willamette Home Inspection is a dependable choice for both residential and specialty inspections.

Comprehensive Inspection Services for Every Property Type

Every home has unique characteristics, and no two inspections should be treated the same. Willamette Home Inspection offers a full suite of services to meet the needs of modern homeowners as well as those purchasing older or more complex properties.

For buyers or owners of older or historic homes, inspections are conducted with special attention to aging materials, structural integrity, and long-term safety concerns. These properties often require a trained eye to identify issues that may not be immediately visible but could become costly over time.

For those investing in new construction, Willamette Home Inspection helps ensure that newly built homes meet proper standards before move-in. Even new builds can have hidden defects, and an independent inspection provides peace of mind before final acceptance.

The company also specializes in pest and dry rot inspections, identifying damage that can compromise structural stability if left untreated. Early detection can save homeowners thousands of dollars in future repairs.

Additional inspection services include:

Roof inspections to assess wear, damage, and potential leaks

Foundation inspections to identify cracks, settling, or structural concerns

Condo, duplex, and multi-plex inspections, tailored to shared and multi-unit properties

Manufactured home inspections, addressing unique construction elements

Log home inspections, which require specialized knowledge of wood structures

Environmental and Specialized Testing

Beyond standard visual inspections, Willamette Home Inspection also offers important environmental and specialty services. Mold sampling helps identify potential health risks, while radon testing detects invisible gases that may pose long-term health concerns. Sewer scoping allows clients to evaluate underground sewer lines, identifying blockages or damage before they become major problems.

These services are especially valuable for buyers who want a complete understanding of a property’s condition, not just what’s visible on the surface.
